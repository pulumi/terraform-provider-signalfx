# Resource: signalfx_aws_external_integration

SignalFx AWS CloudWatch integrations using security tokens. For help with this integration see [Connect to AWS CloudWatch](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/amazon-web-services.html#connect-to-aws).

~> **NOTE** When managing integrations you'll need to use an admin token to authenticate the SignalFx provider.

~> **WARNING** This resource implements a part of a workflow. You must use it with `signalfx_aws_integration`.

## Example Usage

  // Stuff here that uses the external and account ID
}

resource "signalfx_aws_integration" "aws_myteam" {
    enabled = true

    integration_id = signalfx_aws_token_integration.aws_myteam_token.id
    token = "put_your_token_here"
