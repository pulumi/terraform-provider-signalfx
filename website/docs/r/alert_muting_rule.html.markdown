  Allows creation and management of SignalFx Alert Muting Rules

# Resource: signalfx_alert_muting_rule

Provides a SignalFx resource for managing alert muting rules. See [Mute Notifications](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/detect-alert/mute-notifications.html) for more information.

~> **WARNING** SignalFx does not allow the start time of a **currently active** muting rule to be modified. As such, attempting to modify a currently active rule will destroy the existing rule and create a new rule. This may result in the emission of notifications.

## Example Usage

```tf
resource "signalfx_alert_muting_rule" "rool_mooter_one" {
  description = "mooted it NEW"

  start_time = 1573063243
  stop_time  = 0 # Defaults to 0

  detectors = [signalfx_detector.some_detector_id]

  filter {
    property       = "foo"
    property_value = "bar"
  }
}
```
