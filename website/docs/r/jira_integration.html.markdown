# Resource: signalfx_jira_integration

SignalFx Jira integrations. For help with this integration see [Integration with Jira](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/admin-guide/integrate-notifications.html#integrate-with-jira).

~> **NOTE** When managing integrations you'll need to use an admin token to authenticate the SignalFx provider. Otherwise you'll receive a 4xx error.
